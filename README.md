# Web Summarizer with GPT-4

A simple web application that summarizes the content of web pages using Puppeteer and OpenAI's GPT-4 API. This project leverages web scraping to extract the text content of a web page and then uses the GPT-4 model to generate a concise summary.

## Features

**Web Scraping with Puppeteer:** Automates the process of visiting a web page and extracting its textual content.

**Text Summarization with GPT-4:** Uses OpenAI's GPT-4 API to create a summary of the extracted text.

**Express.js Backend:** Provides a simple REST API for the frontend to request summaries.

**Frontend Interface:** A basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend that allows users to input URLs and receive summaries.
